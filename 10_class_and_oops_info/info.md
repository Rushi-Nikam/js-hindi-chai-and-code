## why use oops

## parts of oops
- object literal
- constructor function
- Prototype 
- Classes
- Instances (new, this)


## 4 pillar

 - Inheritance 
 - Polymorphism

## constructor function
 - new keyword is also a constructor function 
 - when we use new keyword they create a empty object firstly and it's called instance
 - step one 
   object creating
 - step two
   constructor function is called by the new keyword
   they pass all argument and other info
 - step three
    all argument are injected in the this keyword
 - step four 
    we find all argument by using console.log();
